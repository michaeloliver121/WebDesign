I was able to figure out a lot on my own this time, and it was fun to experiment with the inline boxes and what not. I checked out Inline Flex, which seemed super cool, although I wasn't sure how to get everything to align the way I wanted. Overall I think the website it improving (slowly), and it's helpful to see what everyone else is up to as well. I'm doing pretty okay I guess, although I hope I can start on a different project soon!
