<p>In a world altered by a brief extraterrestrial visit, humanity grapples with the mysterious remnants left behind. These alien artifacts, scattered across six Visitation Zones, defy earthly logic and offer limitless potential. The Zones become a source of fascination and danger, drawing scientists, governments, and opportunists alike. The story centers on Redrick Schuhart, a "stalker" who illegally ventures into the Zone to retrieve these alien objects. The Zones are perilous, filled with inexplicable phenomena and deadly traps, yet they promise unimaginable wealth and power. As Redrick navigates this treacherous landscape, he becomes entangled in a web of greed, loyalty, and the quest for knowledge, all while the true nature of the alien visit remains a tantalizing mystery.</p>
