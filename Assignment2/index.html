<h3>An Excerpt from an Interview with Dr. Valentine Pillman</h3>
<h4>Prologue</h4>
<p> This interview starts the book off with essentially a reflection on what an alien visit actually would mean for humans, and that the biggest discovery isn't necessarily alien tech, but the realization that humans aren't alone in the universe, and that our existence could be of little importance in the grand scale of things.</p>
