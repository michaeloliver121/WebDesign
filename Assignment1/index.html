<h1>Roadside Picnic</h1>

<h2>A Novel by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Roadside Picnic is a 1972 science fiction novel by Russian authors Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, exploring the aftermath of a brief alien visitation that left behind mysterious, dangerous "Zones" filled with valuable artifacts. The story follows "stalkers," illegal scavengers who risk their lives to retrieve these alien objects from the hazardous Zones for a black market, all while dealing with the philosophical questions of humanity's place in the universe, inspired by the idea that the aliens' visit was merely a "roadside picnic".</p>

<h3>AN EXCERPT FROM AN INTERVIEW WITH DR. VALENTINE PILLMAN BY A CORRESPONDENT FROM HARMONT RADIO, AFTER THE FORMER RECEIVED THE 19—NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS.</h3>

<p> This interview starts the book off with essentially a reflection on what an alien visit actually would mean for humans, and that the biggest discovery isn't necessarily alien tech, but the realization that humans aren't alone in the universe.</p>
