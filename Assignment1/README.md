# Peer Feedback

I only had one bit of peer feedback for this assignment and it was something that I had already planned on doing, but I basically just changed the font up a bit for me legibility. I made it match the colors of the Roadside Picnic cover art so the page comes together a bit more and makes it a bit easier to read overall!

# Reflection

I genuinely don't know why I was struggling with Figma so much, but I am so used to using apps like InDesign, I think the different layouts had me really confused. I noticed that if I typed out my full paragraphs on Figma, they would just completely go off the page and exit their text boxes, which I though was weird. I also couldn't figure out how to add more text boxes without it doing the same and pretty much changing the entire document. Weirdly enough, at least right now, I think HTML is a bit easier for me to understand, but I would like to learn more about Figma moving forward. Anyways, I think the page came together well for what it is, I had to do some digging to remember exactly how to change text color, font, and embedding images... but I think it turned out great! Sorry it doesn't fully match the Figma website though, it was really a struggle! 😳
